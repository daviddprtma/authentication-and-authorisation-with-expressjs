In this implementation, I added a function for the user who can delete their username after authentication. For my idea, giving an authorization for the regular user to delete other user is a bad idea because if the user that we want to delete are the admin, then we'll lost our role as an admin who can manage everything in our apps. So for the regular use, we must avoid them to delete each other user and only who have an admin role, who can delete the user. And in here I'll discuss & explain to you what is Authentication & Authorization in this bounty challenge: 

- Authentication: Authentication is a process in which the credentials provided are compared to those on file in a database of authorized users' information on a local operating system or within an authentication server. If the credentials match, the process is completed and the user is granted authorization for access. 

- Authorization: Authorization defines what actions a user is allowed to perform after theyâ€™ve been authenticated. It involves granting or denying access to specific resources or functionality.

To make it more understanding, here is the diagram for the authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Token) :
